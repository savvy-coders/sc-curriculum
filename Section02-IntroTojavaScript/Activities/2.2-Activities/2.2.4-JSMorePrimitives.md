# Create a new file
1. Inside Class Activities, add a new file called `2.2.4-JSMorePrimitives.js`
    1. In the file name, there are no spaces. Computers don't like spaces so the name is written in camel case
    2. The suffix of the file is .js. This is because we will be using JavaScript

# Activity
## Copy the following commented lines into the new file you created:

// create five variables and assign them values
// each variable should reference a different primitive data type
// ! REMEMBER: you should never DELIBERATELY assign "undefined" to a variable


// print the type of each variable in this order:
// string, number, boolean, undefined, null


// create a variable that references a template literal
// inside the template literal, use two variables


// reassign the value of the variable that references "null"


// print the value and its type


// print a variable that causes a ReferenceError


// alter the previous line to no longer cause a ReferenceError


## While going through this activity, navigate to Homework Repo -> Class Activities.
## To print what you are working on, type 'node 2.2.4-JSMorePrimitives.js'

# Pushing the activity up to GitHub (in the development branch)
1. Open your terminal
2. Type `git add 2.2.4-JSMorePrimitives.js`
3. Type `git status`
    1. The file name should appear in green, saying it is ready to be staged
4. Type `git commit -m "JS Variables and Primitives Part 4"`
5. Type `git status`
    1. The file name should not appear, meaning it is waiting to be pushed up to GitHub
5. Type `git push`
6. Type `git status`
    1. The working tree should be clean
    2. This means that the changes you have made are in GitHu
