# Create a new file
1. Inside Class Activities, add a new file called `2.2.2-JSVariablesAndPrimitives.js`
    1. In the file name, there are no spaces. Computers don't like spaces so the name is written in camel case
    2. The suffix of the file is .js. This is because we will be using JavaScript

# Activity
## Copy the following commented lines into the new file you created:

// create a variable called "name" that references a string


// create a variable called "favoriteSong" that references a string


// create a variable called "wage" that references a number


// create a variable called "age" that references a number


// create a variable called "onlyChild" that references a boolean


// create a variable called "satisfied" that references a boolean


// create a variable called "favoriteThing" that references ANY primitive value
// print the data type of "favoriteThing"


// ! You heard a new song that became your favorite.
// Reassign the variable "favoriteSong"


// ! You no longer like the type of data stored in "favoriteThing"
// Reassign "favoriteThing" to a different primitive data type and print its type


// ! Happy Birthday!
// Reassign "age" to a new value


// ! You got a big raise at work.
// Reassign "wage" to a new value


// ! Your raise changed your job satisfaction.
// Assign "satisfied" to true


// use "console.log()" and "+" to print a sentence that includes two variables
