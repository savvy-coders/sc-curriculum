# Steps to complete creating a new file

1. Go to the terminal and navigate to your Homework Repo
2. Create a new branch in your Homework Repo called development
    1. In your terminal,type the command `git checkout -b development`
    2. You should now see development in parenthesis instead of master
    3. Open VS code by typing the command `code .`
3. Create a new folder called `Class Activities`
4. Inside Class Activities, add a new file called `2.2.1-JSVariablesAndPrimitives.js`
    1. In the file name, there are no spaces. Computers don't like spaces so the name is written in camel case
    2. The suffix of the file is .js. This is because we will be using JavaScript

# Activity

## Copy the following commented lines into the new file you created:

```javascript
// create a constant variable (const)

// create a variable that can be reassigned (let)

// create three variables and assign them values of different data types (=)

// print the types of two variables that reference two different data types (typeof)
// TIP: console.log() prints a value in the console/terminal

// change the value referenced by a variable (dynamic typing)

// print the type of the variable you just changed (typeof)

// create variables and give them values to complete the sentences that will print
// ? which variables need to be created?
// ? what type of data needs to go in each variable?
```

## While going through this activity, navigate to Homework Repo -> Class Activities.

## To print what you are working on, type `node 2.2.1-JSVariablesAndPrimitives.js`

## Pushing the activity up to GitHub (in the development branch)

1. Open your terminal
2. Type `git add 2.2.1-JSVariablesAndPrimitives.js`
3. Type `git status`
    1. The file name should appear in green, saying it is ready to be staged
4. Type `git commit -m "JS Variables and Primitives"`
5. Type `git status`
    1. The file name should not appear, meaning it is waiting to be pushed up to GitHub
6. Type `git push --set-upstream origin development`
7. Type `git status`
    1. The working tree should be clean
    2. This means that the changes you have made are in GitHub
