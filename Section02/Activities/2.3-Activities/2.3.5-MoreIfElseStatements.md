# Create a new file in your Homework Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your homework Repo, then Class Activities
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `2.3.5-MoreIfElseStatements.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

```javascript
// replace the 1 with different numbers to test different conditions
let num = 1;

// ? fill in all the parentheses with conditions to log the correct statements
if ( ) {
  console.log("The number is greater than 100.");
} else if ( ) {
  console.log("The number is less than or equal to 40");
} else if ( ) {
  console.log("The number is 42")
} else if ( ) {
  console.log("The number is greater than or equal to 45.")
} else {
  // ? finish the statement with the only three numbers the number could be at this point inthe if statement
  console.log("The number is one of these three numbers: , , .")
```
