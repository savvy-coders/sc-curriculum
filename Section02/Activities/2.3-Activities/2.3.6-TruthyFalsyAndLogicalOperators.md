# Create a new file in your Homework Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your homework Repo, then Class Activities
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `2.3.6-TruthyFalsyAndLogicalOperators.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

```javascript
// Logical Operators
// ? what do you expect each line to print?
console.log(true && false);
console.log(true || false);
console.log(!true);
console.log(!(true && false));
console.log(false || !false);

// Logical Operators and Truthy/Falsy
// ? what do you expect each line to print?
console.log("" && 0);
console.log(undefined || null);
console.log(!``);
console.log(!(1 && "false"));
console.log(NaN || !"true");

// ? TO DO: set the age variable equal to a number, then use the conditional operator to construct an expression that returns "full menu" if the age is over 10, and "kids menu" if the age is less than 10
let age;

// ? TO DO: using only logical operators (no comparison operators), write an if statement that prints "The number is zero" when num is 0.
let num = 0;
// * your if statement here *
```

## While you are working, you can see what is printed to the console by typing `node 2.3.6-TruthyFalsyAndLogicalOperators.js` in the terminal
