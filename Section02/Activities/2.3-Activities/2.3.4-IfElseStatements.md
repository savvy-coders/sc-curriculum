# Create a new file in your Homework Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your homework Repo, then Class Activities
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `2.3.4-IfElseStatements.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

```javascript
let age = 25;

// if age is greater than or equal to 25,
if (age >= 25) {
  console.log("Renting a car is more affordable.")
} else {
  // else: age is less than 25
  console.log("Renting a car is very expensive.")
}

// chaining if statements: if - else if - ... - else
// if age is greater than or equal to 25,
if (age >= 25) {
  console.log("Renting a car is more affordable.")
} else if (age >=18) {
  // else: age is less than 25
  // if age is greater than or equal to 18
  console.log("Renting a car is very expensive.")
} else {
  // else: age is less than 18
  console.log("You cannot legally rent a car.")
}
```
