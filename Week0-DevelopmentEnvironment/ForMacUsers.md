5. Check that you have installed everything correctly by running the following commands in your terminal:
   - `node -v`
     - you should see something like `v12.13.0` (the exact numbers may not match)
   - `git --version`
     - you should see something like `git version 2.27.0` (the exact numbers may not match)
