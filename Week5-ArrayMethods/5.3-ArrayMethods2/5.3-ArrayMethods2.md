# More Array Methods
Array methods like `pop()` and `slice()` are useful to alter the _content_ of arrays, adding or removing values, but it would be great if we didn't have to construct a `for` or `while` loop to "go over"/alter each value in the array. Luckily, we have `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` built into every array!

These four array methods each take a _callback function_ as their argument. The callback can be invoked with up to three arguments:
1. the value of the element
2. the index of the element
3. the Array object being traversed

```javascript
someArray.forEach((curr, i, arr) => {
  console.log("current value in array", curr);
  console.log("index of value in array", i);
  console.log("array that value is in", arr);
})
```
These array methods **do not mutate** the array on which it is called (although callback, if invoked, may do so).

> **NOTE**: These array methods operate on the state of the array _at the time it is passed in_. If you add or remove values, those changes won't be reflected in the elements the method is "looping" over. 
> 
> Also, the array methods are not called for _missing elements_ of the array: indexes that have _never been set_, indexes which have been _deleted_, or indexes which have _never been assigned a value_.

## `.forEach()`
The `forEach()` method executes a provided function once for each array element. `forEach()` always returns `undefined`. 
```javascript
const nums = [3, 7, 11]
const doubled = []

nums.forEach(num => doubled.push(num*2))

console.log(nums)
// [3, 7, 11]
console.log(doubled)
// [6, 14, 22]
```

---
`forEach()` is nice, but it would be even more useful (especially for **functional programming**) if it _returned_ something - perhaps a new array, or some _other_ data type...


---
## `.map()`
The `map()` method calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, and constructs and **returns** a _new array_ from the _results_. 

Because `map()` uses the _results_ from the callback function, it is important to remember to **`return`** a value from the callback function - using the `return` keyword or a _one-line arrow function_.
```javascript
const nums = [3, 7, 11]

const doubled = nums.map(num => num*2)

console.log(nums)
// [3, 7, 11]
console.log(doubled)
// [6, 14, 22]
```

## `.filter()`
`filter()` calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, constructing and returning a new array of all the values for which callback returns a truthy value. 

Because `filter` is ultimately looking for a **boolean** value, the callback function's _return statement_ often utilizes a **comparison operator**.

Unlike `map()` (which returns an array with the _same amount of values_ as the array on which it is called), `filter()` returns an array that has **at most** the same amount of values as the original array, probably less. 
```javascript
const customers = [{id: 1, purchases: 5}, {id: 2, purchases: 1}]

const repeatCustomers = customers.filter(customer => customer.purchases > 1)

console.log(repeatCustomers)
// [{id: 1, purchases: 5}]
```

## `.reduce()`
The `reduce()` method calls a provided callback function on each element of the array, resulting in/_returning_ a **single output value**.

The reducer callback function is a little different, as it takes _four_ arguments:

1. Accumulator (acc)
2. Current Value (curr)
3. Current Index (i)
4. Source Array (arr)
```javascript
// 
someArray.reduce((acc, curr, i, arr) => {
  console.log("current accumulator value", acc)
  console.log("current value in array", curr)
  console.log("current index of value in array", i)
  console.log("array that value is in", arr)
  // add current value to accumulator value
  return acc + curr
})
```
Your callback function's _returned value_ is _assigned_ to the **accumulator**. The accumulator value is _remembered_ across each iteration over every element in the array, and the accumulator ultimately becomes the **final, single returned value**.

```javascript
const nums = [3, 7, 11, 13]

let sumTotal = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num)

console.log(sumTotal)
// 34

const customers = [{id: 1, purchases: 5}, {id: 2, purchases: 1}]

let totalPurchases = customers.reduce((total, customer) => total + customer.purchases)

console.log(totalPurchases)
// "[object Object]1"
// not QUITE what we wanted...
```
### initialValue parameter in `reduce`
We returned that strange string in the last example because reduce added a number to an object and JS coerced those mixed data types into a string. But where did that object come from? And how can we solve this problem?

In addition to the accumulator value, `reduce()` has another quirk that `map` and `filter` don't have: `reduce` takes up to _two_ arguments - the callback function common to all of these four array methods, and an **initialValue** for the accumulator.

```javascript
someArray.reduce(callback, initialValue)
// OR
someArray.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, initialValue)
```
If _no initialValue_ is provided, then accumulator will be equal to the **first value in the array**, and _currentValue_ will be equal to the _second_. This is cause of the unexpected object in the example above.

If initialValue **is** provided, then accumulator will be _equal to initialValue_, and _currentValue_ will be equal to the _first_ value in the array.

```javascript
const customers = [{id: 1, purchases: 5, email: null}, {id: 2, purchases: 1, email: "email@example.net"}]

let totalPurchases = customers.reduce((total, customer) => total + customer.purchases, 0)
// notice the ", 0" at the end of the line above, that 0 sets the initial value for the accumulator 'total'

console.log(totalPurchases)
// 6

let customerSummary = customers.reduce((summary, customer) => {
  summary.totalCustomers += 1;
  summary.totalPurchases += customer.purchases;
  if (customer.email) {
    summary.totalEmailAddresses += 1;
  }
  summary.emailPercent = summary.totalEmailAddresses / summary.totalCustomers;
  return summary
  }, {
    totalCustomers: 0, 
    totalPurchases: 0, 
    totalEmailAddresses: 0,
    emailPercent: 0
    })

  console.log(customerSummary)
  // {totalCustomers: 2, totalPurchases: 6, totalEmailAddresses: 1, emailPercent: 0.5}
```
