# Homework and Goals

## Goal: _Mastery of these Skills_

- cloning a GitHub repo
- adding, committing, pushing to GitHub
- naming, with attention to detail
- string & number data types, `typeof`
- template literal use
- `if` comprehension
- loops, modulo

## Goal: _Capstone work_

- UI/UX: Select a color pallet for your website
- UI/UX: Plan site navigation and Nav elements like buttons
- Start searching for an API to use/consume in your application. Examples:
  - [10 Fun API's to Inspire Your Next Project](https://dev.to/nialljoemaher/10-fun-api-s-to-inspire-your-next-project-3224)
  - [Collection of Free Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#public-apis--)
  - Social Media API's

## Set-up your Homework repo on GitHub

1. Use the [Savvy-Homework template repo](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-homework) to _create a new GitHub repo for homework_ - name it something that indicates it is for **Savvy Coders Homework**
2. _Clone the repo_ to your machine

## Pizza Place Homework

3. Open the new homework directory in VS Code and _create a new JavaScript file_ - name it something that indicates it is homework for **Week 2**
4. Inside your JS file, create two variables: `pizzaPlace` and `numberOfToppings`
5. Have the variables reference the _name of your Pizza Place_ and the _number of toppings_ your Pizza Place offers.
6. _Print the variables and their types_.
7. _Print a template literal_ that uses both variables to construct a short sentence about your Pizza Place.
8. _Construct an `if` statement_ that prints `"Quality, not quantity."` if you offer less than 10 toppings, or `"A whole lot of pizza."` if you offer 10 or more toppings.
9. _Add, commit, and push_ your JS file to your GitHub repo.
10. Send your TA a link to your GitHub Homework repo when finished.

### Bonus Challenge

11. Use a _loop_ to print all of the _even_ numbers from 1 to `numberOfToppings` (or 10)
