## <b>PREREQUISITES</b>
<p>A fundamental desire to learn to code is the only major requirement. Students are assigned pre-work and directed to prepare their laptops with the appropriate tooling.</p>

## <b>COURSE OBJECTIVES</b>
<ul>
  <li>Gain confidence with shell commands and git.</li>
  <li>Understand general concepts associated with the client-server and request-response cycle.</li>
  <li>Generate documents using Markdown.</li>
  <li>Apply semantic HTML and modern CSS to build responsive web layouts.</li>
  <li>Use JS to add interactivity to web pages.</li>
  <li>Use JS to manage data.</li>
  <li>Apply a model-view-updater architecture to create a modern, state-driven single-page application written in vanilla ES2015+ JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Use JS to build a CRUD server utilizing Node.js and Express.</li>
  <li>Manage long-term data storage via CRUD server and PostgreSQL database.</li>
  <li>Pass both Master Class Level and advanced Certified AGILE Professional courses and receive both certificates.</li>
</ul>

## <b>COURSE DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>Over an intense 12 weeks, students will be taken from knowing just a few basics of web development to being fully qualified for junior developer positions.</p>

<p>The technical portion of our 12-week core curriculum starts by teaching students all about web/software development tooling. This would include version control, text editors, and shell commands and modern linters to help ensure high-quality code. Students start by learning Markdown. Next students apply modern HTML/CSS to create responsive website layouts. From then on, we focus on JS - DOM interactions, managing collections of data by composing functions, receiving data from an API, and converting a traditional static site into a Single Page Application.   After learning how to create and manage a web-page on the front end, students will then learn to create a Node.js CRUD server. They will use this server to manage long-term data storage via a PostgreSQL database.</p>

## <b>COURSE CURRICULUM</b>
<p>The main course curriculum is usually updated in between cohort sessions based on prior student outcomes. This is our GIT book-basically your “textbook” supplied via the internet.</p>

## <b>ATTENDANCE POLICY</b>
<p>Attendance is mandatory. Missing a class can really set you behind. There is a lot of material to keep up with - this is a ‘boot camp’, after all.</p>

## EMERGENCY CLOSURE STATEMENT
<p>In case of an emergency closure, a makeup class will be on Friday.</p>

## DISABILITY & ACCESS CENTER
<p>Savvy Coders accommodates students from all backgrounds or challenges as much as possible.</p>
