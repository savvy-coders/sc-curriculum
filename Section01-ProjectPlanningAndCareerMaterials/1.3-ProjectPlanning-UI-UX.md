# Project Planning
### The steps to planning your project successfully

## Define your Project

#### What is an appropriate capstone project? ####

- What is a "business problem" that you want to solve?  Do you have anything in your personal life that frustrates you that you could see an app solving in some way?
- Do you have a business  yourself that you could see an app solving a business problem you have?
- Do you have a friend or someone you know with a business that could use an app to solve a business problem?
- Do you have a product or a service that you would like to create an app for and build a web presence?  Ecommerce site?
- Do research on websites - Google to see if someone has already made an application based on your idea - pick it apart to see what you like, do not like and how you can make it better.

#### Capstone Project Guidelines: ####

- Students must complete and effective present a capstone project.  Said project will meet the following general requirements:
    - Display an effective approach to the project planning process.  This includes wire frames, UI/UX design, Trello board.
    - Display an understanding of semantic HTML and modern CSS approaches.
    - Render as a Single Page Application using a 'state' object and a 'render' function to display 'views'.
    - Demonstrate the use of Git, including a sensical, well-organized 'commit' history
    - Use an external API to send/receive data and update the Single Page Application views
    - Incorporate a backend Restful API using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB
    - Deploy Single Page Application and Backend API to Netlify and Heroku respectively.
    - Should display your development skills and creativity in a professional manner
    - Can be completed in the allotted time frame.

## Define your Audience

#### Who is the target audience for the capstone project?  Do research! ####

- It's not you!
- Mentor & Peers
- Recruiters & Career Coaches
- Hiring Managers
- Ultimately the consumer of your product

How is your idea different, better, define your audience and run your ideas by them to get feedback on what they would like to see in an application?  Document their feedback and keep in mind / refer to as your building out your application.

---

## Determine what YOUR project will be. ##

#### Create a high level story you want tell with your project. ####

- This will be your elevator pitch for your capstone project and used during demo day.

"I want to create a web APPLICATION that allows users to ask questions via chat during a talk and add resources to videos."

---

## Define your Content

#### Determine what pages you need and the content of each page. ####

- Don't worry about look and feel or style of the content, that comes later.

1. Make a list of pages
1. Write a brief description of the content for each page
    1. Navigation
    1. Main Content
    1. Footer

---

## Define your User Flow ##

#### What interactions will the user be required to do to use your web application. ####

Example: E-commerce Application

![Sample User FLow](img/Savvy_Coders_User_Flow_Example.png)

- Focus on page flow not content of pages
- Make sure you analyze all user flows, creating multiple flow charts if necessary.

---

## Create Wire Frames ##

#### Now that you think you know what you want to create.

- The wireframes should be crude.  We are not creating pixel perfect representations of your website.
- Start with pencil and paper or whiteboard
   - Then if desired, move into a digital version.
- Create at least one per page.
   - If a page has suffocated user interaction, multiple wireframes for a single page may be required.
- Create wireframes for both different screen sizes.  I.E.: mobile and desktop.
- They should be proportionally correct.
- They should identify the content to be placed on each page but not display actual content.
- They should annotate any user interactions.

#### Start with pencil and paper or whiteboard, then if necessary create a digital version

# Basic UI/UX Design

## Designing your Web Application Interactions

### User Experience (UX)

- Keep it INTUITIVE
  - Navigation should be obvious
- Make it consistent
  - Follow the "standard" for interactions a.k.a clicking a hamburger icon should open the navigation and chevrons should open drawers.
  - Keep interactions the same across the application
- Allow users to make errors by handlers errors gracefully aka: form validation that asks the user to correct inputs that are not correct

## Design your Web Application Interface

### User Interface (UI)

#### Responsive Design or Mobile First layout

- Rearrange (stack) elements on narrow screens
- Hide/Show different elements based on screen size
- Adjust font sizes, bigger on smaller screens

Resources

- [Mobile First versus Responsive Web Design](https://darwindigital.com/mobile-first-versus-responsive-web-design/)
- [Mobile First is just not good enough meet journey driven design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/mobile-first-is-just-not-good-enough-meet-journey-driven-design/)

#### Fonts & Icons

- Find alternate fonts for logos and headers to make them stand out.
- Use icons only where appropriate.

Resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

#### Images

- Due to copyright law, images need to be your own originals, or licensed Creative Commons or Public Domain

Resources

- [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/creative-commons-images)

#### Color & Contrast

- Pick a color palette and stick to it
- Keep accessibility in mind

  - Visually impaired & colorblind

Resources:

- [Coolors](https://coolors.co)
- [Paletton](http://paletton.com)
- [Colorspire](https://www.colorspire.com)

#### Navigation

- Again, it should be intuitive

#### Animations

- Only implement after your web app is fully functional
- Can be very time-consuming for little benefit

Resources

- [Intro to CSS Animations](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/97-intro-to-css-animations/)

## Define your Timeline

### How much time do you have to complete your project?

- Estimate the amount of time you have on a daily/weekly basis
  - Example: Approximately 2 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks = 40 hours (this is an aggressive timeline)
- This number is used to estimate whether completion of the Capstone project can be done on time
- Plan to complete your capstone project including testing by the Demo Day practice, so you can fine tune & polish the application before Demo Day

## Create your Kanban Board

### Trello.com

> [Click here to learn more about Trello](1.3.1-TrelloKanbanBoard.md)

<br>

1. If you don't already have one, create an account on trello.com
1. Create a new board
   1. Name the board something meaningful regarding your capstone project
1. Share your board with the Instructors and Teacher's Assistants
1. Create swin lanes which represent each step in the development process

   1. Backlog
      1. Brainstorming and story/bug writing
   1. Ready for development
      1. Story writing completed, full details and acceptance criteria
   1. In Progress
      1. Stories currently being worked (should be limited to 1 or 2)

## Create your Stories/Bugs

1. Create a card, could be classified as a story (new feature) or a bug (defect in the code)

   1. Steps to creating a card
      1. Add a title
         1. Should be a BRIEF description of the requested feature or defect
      1. Define "Definition of Done"
         1. Story
            1. "As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]..."
         1. Bug
            1. Describe how to reproduce the defect and what should be done to correct the issue.
      1. Prioritize
         1. HTML comes before CSS and JavaScript, then Backend API...
      1. Estimate
         1. In hours how long you expect it to complete
      1. MVP (Minimum Viable Product), Optional, Future

Stories are NOT tasks, they are the definition of a feature

- You should task out each story, such as write the HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which we will cover next

- [Example of thought process for a simple task such as create a PBJ Sandwich](https://youtu.be/5X58UgQpGyQ)

## Task out your Stories/Bugs

1. Create a task list within your story/bug

   1. Use the Github checklist within the description section to add a list of tasks
      1. Define tasks required to fulfill the definition of done
      1. Prioritize the tasks and sort by priority
      1. Estimate/Time Box
         1. Keep in mind your total time line estimate from earlier
         1. For tasks you haven't done before, multiple by 1.5 or 2
         1. Time boxing, determine the max time to spend on an optional feature
            1. Once that time has elapsed, stop work and reevaluate if there is a better use of your time

### Example Story

![](img/story-example.png)

## Develop your Web Application

### THe FUN part

- Update your kanban board as you start and complete stories and tasks.
- You and others should be able to gauge your completeness by the board status.

## Test your Web Application

### What you should be testing?

- Make sure it behaves correctly.
- Make sure it looks correct, at different window sizes

#### How should you test?

- Test as stories are completed
- Test on many devices and resolutions
- Test in multiple web browsers
  - Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, if suicidal Internet Explorer
- Have others test
  - You should observe them testing and listen to their feedback
  - Have teacher, mentors, peers, friend (smart & dumb), your kids, your parents


## Homework! - Create Documentation

1. If you have not done so yet - create an account for yourself on Github [www.github.com](www.github.com).   Make sure the name is professional.
1. If you haven't already done so, create your capstone repo from the [Savvy Starter](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter) template and clone your capstone repo.
1. Navigate to your capstone repo on your local development environment
1. Create a docs folder and add documentation in the form of markdown, images or PDFs.
    1. [Documenting your projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)
    1. [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
1. Update your README.md file to link to your new project documentation

### Your documentation should include

- Definition of your audience (We already did this, correct?)
- Definition statement (I want to create a web application that...) for your project
- High level story (elevator pitch)
- Outline of the content
- User Flow
- Wire frames (1 wireframe per page minimum, hand-drawn is ok!)
- Document selected fonts, icons, images and color scheme

Going forward you should document any decisions made such as third party APIs, REST API design, etc.

The documentation will be included in your portfolio, so make it look nice.
